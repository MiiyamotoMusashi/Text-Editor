# PyCode Studio

## Description
PyCode Studio is a text editor application built with Python and the PySide6 library. It provides a dark-themed interface for writing and editing text files, with features such as undo/redo, word wrap, and file handling (open, save, save as).

## Goal
In the future, the aim is to turn this simple text editor into a complete IDE, expanding its functionality to include features such as code debugging, support for some programming languages and more.

## Features
- **Open File**: Open existing text files into the editor.
- **Save File**: Save the current text in the editor to the opened file.
- **Save As**: Save the current text in the editor to a new file.
- **Undo/Redo**: Undo or redo the last action.
- **Word Wrap**: Deactivates the word wrap.

## Installation
To run PyCode Studio, you need to have Python and PySide6 installed. After cloning the repository, you can run the application with the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```
